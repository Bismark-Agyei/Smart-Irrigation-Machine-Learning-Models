# Smart-Irrigation-Machine-Learning-Models
This repository showcases machine learning models applied to smart farming,it provides a data driven thresholds for irrigation  compared to predefined ones. Using real soil/crop data  and  synthetic soil /crop data, I implemented  Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM to predict soil properties, yield, and irrigation needs.
